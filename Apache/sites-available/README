#
## Apache sites-available & sites-enabled folders
#
The "sites-available" folder contains all available VirtualHost *.conf files,
 but none of them are automatically included in the Apache config.

The "sites-enabled" folder contains symlinks to any VirtualHost configuration
 files in "sites-available", which you want Apache to "include" & enable.

NOTE: Apache processes included ".conf" files in alphabetical order, which may
 have a bearing on your config file naming scheme.

Run the following, within sites-enabled, to "enable" an "available" site
% sudo ln -s ../sites-available/SITENAME.conf

Run this, to check the included configs' syntax and VirtualHost order
% sudo apachectl -S

Restart Apache, making changes take effect (without aborting curently
 open connections)
% sudo apachectl graceful

NOTE: Some config changes will not take effect after a graceful restart, so you
may need to issue a full Apache restart, like this
% sudo apachectl restart
